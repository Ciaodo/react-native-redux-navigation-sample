# react-native-redux-navigation-sample
Sample counter application. Includes react-native, react-navigation, react-redux, redux-logger, redux-thunk

To run this sample app, install [Expo](https://expo.io/) and create Expo project, copy App.js and src folder into the project. You can try either on your smart phone or android emulator. I use [GenyMotion](https://www.genymotion.com/fun-zone/) to emulate.
